\section{Methodology}
An application was produced to test the hypothesis. This application used the Games Education Framework [reference] 

\subsection{Application Design}


\subsection{Test Environment Design}
The application simulated an environment, in which two flocks interact (one of which is improved via a genetic algorithm) within a limited space of scarce resources, with the aim of finding out if a flocking algorithm improved by a genetic algorithm can outcompete one without.

\subsection{Flocking Algorithm Design}
