\section{Background and Literature Review}
	
	\subsection{Flocking Algorithm}
	Flocking, since its initial algorithmic conception and discussion in academics \citep{Reynolds:1987:FHS:37402.37406},
	is a field of study that has been expanded on in various ways. This section aims to explore the literature since then,
	exploring the expansions to the boids model from its origins.
	
	The implementation is sourced from an example on processing.org [citation here]
