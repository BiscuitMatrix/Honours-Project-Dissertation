\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Flocking in Nature - Swarm Behaviour}
Flocking algorithms draw a lot of their inspiration from the behaviour of flocks in the natural world \citep{flake1998computational}. As there are many examples of this behaviour in organisms across the planet \citep{Swarm: Nature's Incredible Invasions}% Not cited properly yet you need to update this after checking the cite them right book
, there is a lot of information and insight that can be gleaned on how to design these algorithms.


\paragraph{Leadership and Consensus}
The way leadership in a flock emerges is varied. The two main ways % Potentially revise this tbh

An interesting look at this can be found in the behaviour of pigeons. A study conducted into the behaviour of these birds in a flock \citep{Jorge2414} found in their research 
% Here we can mention eusocial insects and their very dominant hierarchy (e.g. Queens of the hive/nest) Queens can be picked though! This may be interesting to explore
% The main thing we can explore here is consensus vs leadership

\subsection{Flocking Algorithm}
%Flocking, since its initial algorithmic conception and discussion in academics \citep{Reynolds:1987:FHS:37402.37406},
%is a field of study that has been expanded on in various ways. This section aims to explore the literature since then,
%exploring the expansions to the boids model from its origins.
