\section{Results}

\subsection{Testing the effect of sampling method}
The aim of this test was to identify the effects the sampling method may have had on the genetic algorithm. There are two implementations of sampling method in the program: Roulette Wheel (RW), and Stochastic Universal Sampling (SUS).
Two tests were conducted, using each sampling method respectively, the below factors were standardised between the tests:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of Generations: 20000
\item Population Generation: Randomised Method
\item Mutation Probability: 1\%
\item Time Step: 1.5 Simulation Seconds per frame
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing the effect of mutation probability}
This was a test to identify the affect mutation probability had on the genetic makeup of the flock and to identify the affect it may have on the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm as a whole. This required standardising the tests in each run of the GA, these were:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of Generations: 5000
\item Population Generation: Randomised Method
\item Selection Type: Stochastic Universal Sampling
\item Time Step: 1.5 Simulation Seconds per frame
\end{itemize}
Keeping these factors controlled across all tests, 10 tests were then produced with different mutation probabilities: 0.5\%, 1\%, 2\%, 3\%, 4\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, and 25\%.
