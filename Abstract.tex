\section{Abstract}
	
	\subsection{Context}
	Artificial intelligence is a rapidly expanding field, there is a clear useful context in their use in Flocking Techniques.
	
	\subsection{Aim}
	Investigate the impact of AI techniques on the dynamic interaction of flocks with each other to see if this has a 
	beneficial effect in comparision to regular flocking algorithms.
	
	\subsection{Method - description here needs updating!}
	Using an application that models flocking behaviour (developed by the author), observe and compare AI flocking strategies
	to those of regular flocking algorithms. This will be developed using the AI techniques found to be most likely to produce 
	viable intelligent flocking behaviour.
	
	\subsection{Results}
	The analysis of the effectiveness of strategies that the AI come up with in their interactions with other flocks, with
	contrast and comparison to the behaviour of standard flocking algorithms.
	
	\subsection{Conclusion}
	This project will display the flocking strategies that emerge in their interactions with other flocks, and conclude on their
	effectiveness in relation to other strategies and flock type. This will demonstrate the impact the AI techniques have on
	this kind of flocking interaction.
