\paragraph{Context}
Flocking algorithms represent a kind of group behaviour that collectively improves the survival chances of individual members, and using genetic algorithms to improve a flock is an area already under exploration. However, not so looked into is the ability of a genetic algorithm to improve a flocks competitiveness versus a regular flocking algorithm and the changes in behaviours that may result.

\paragraph{Aim}
To develop an environment in which a flock that improves over generations via a genetic algorithm can compete over resources with a regularly implemented flock, using the expanded boids model. Exploring how the genetic algorithm affects the competitiveness of the flock in the environment in survival, potential convergence in evolutionary traits, and emergent situational behaviours.

\paragraph{Method}
A competitve environment with a limited resource pool not suitable to sustain two flock populations was developed. For this environment a flocking algorithm and genetic algorithm were developed.

	%\paragraph{Context}
	%Artificial intelligence is a rapidly expanding field, there is a clear useful context in their use in Flocking Techniques.
	
	%\paragraph{Aim}
	%Investigate the impact of AI techniques on the dynamic interaction of flocks with each other to see if this has a beneficial effect in comparision to regular flocking algorithms.
	
	%\paragraph{Method}
	%Using an application that models flocking behaviour (developed by the author), observe and compare AI flocking strategies to those of regular flocking algorithms. This will be developed using the AI techniques found to be most likely to produce viable intelligent flocking behaviour.
	
	%\paragraph{Results}
	%The analysis of the effectiveness of strategies that the AI come up with in their interactions with other flocks, with contrast and comparison to the behaviour of standard flocking algorithms.
	
	%\paragraph{Conclusion}
	%This project will display the flocking strategies that emerge in their interactions with other flocks, and conclude on their effectiveness in relation to other strategies and flock type. This will demonstrate the impact the AI techniques have on this kind of flocking interaction.
