This can be seen visually represented in Fig.\ref{fig:cohesion}. It displays the cohesion force increasing as a boid moved away from the local flock centre.

This can be seen visually represented in Fig.\ref{fig:alignment}. It displays the alignment force increasing as a boid moved closer to the local flock centre.

This can be seen visually represented in Fig.\ref{fig:separation}. It displays the separation force increasing as the displacement between the nearest flock member and itself decreased. This separation force increased for each neighbouring boid.

This can be seen visually represented in Fig.\ref{fig:foodattraction}. It displays relationship the food attraction force has to the displacement squared of the food resource to the boid. It represents two increases in the food attraction force and a minima inbetween, where the food attraction force decreases as the boid gets near to it, but then switches to an increase past a certain point.

This can be seen visually represented in Fig.\ref{fig:flockavoidance}. It displays the flock avoidance force increasing as a boid moved closer to the local flock centre.
